:: TODO for SiteCheck ::

• Get images from the app to put on the site

• Build a 2x2 front / back style image approach from the home
    - On small only show the back (results) screen, hide the front screen

• To circumvent distribution issues focus on the United States for now, allowing TLS/SSL issues to remain exempt from export compliance
